# Target Tracking on Counter Battery Radars
Kalman Filter approach to target tracking on counter-battery radars, and predictions for impact and shooting points.

# Setup
It is only needed to have Matlab installed. To install it, follow the link down bellow:
https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/student.html

# Execution
Now for executing the script, open the ``application\`` folder and run the ``main.m`` file to run all chosen simulations. Keep in mind that you can always interrupt the application and resume it again. After each simulation your results will be saved or updated in the ``application\results\`` directory. 

For ploting the results, just execute the ``plotResults.m`` file.

If you wish to plot our results instead, just drag the files in ``application\ourResults\`` to ``application\results\`` and execute the ``plotResults.m`` file.
